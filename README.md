Kotli engine is a Kotlin library designed to generate project structures based on blueprint templates of any complexity.

It provides a simplified framework to describe a template as a set of functional blocks.
Prepared templates are self-sufficient, containing all the metadata necessary for presentation and facilitating the multi-step process of generating an output structure.

The online service [Kotli](https://kotlitecture.com) utilizes this framework and the templates based on it as part of its project builder interface.

All detailed documentation about **Kotli** can be found [here](https://kotlitecture.github.io).
