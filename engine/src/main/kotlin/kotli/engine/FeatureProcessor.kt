/**
 * The Feature processor is responsible for the inclusion or exclusion of the feature it implements
 * in the generated template.
 *
 * A feature is any atomic integration, technical solution, or business flow
 * that can be added to a layer during its configuration in Kotli.
 *
 * Each feature should be self-descriptive, allowing it to be presented to the user with an icon, title, description, links,
 * and any other metadata required to understand its value and purpose.
 *
 * The primary advantage of a feature is to provide a ready-to-use solution with minimal configuration required
 * (zero configuration is the goal).
 *
 * By default, each blueprint template should be pre-configured to include all features.
